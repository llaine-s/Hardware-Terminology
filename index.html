	<h3>Input Device</h3>	
	<p>An input device is a type of electronic device or computer hardware such as a camera, keyboard or mouse that is used for providing and delivering data. The information is then processed by a computer or other equipment.</p>

	<a name="output device"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Output Device</h3>
	<p>An output device is an element of computer hardware that translates data sent by input devices into a more understandable form for users to read. These include devices such as speakers, monitors, printers and projectors.</p>

	<a name="central processing unit"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
	<p>The central processing unit, also known as a "CPU", is the circuitry found inside a computer. It fulfills roles and completes instructions using the arithmetic and input and output operations given by the instructions.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="arithmetic logic unit"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
	<p>The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is an integrated circuit within a computer that performs arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication, as well as logic operations, including OR, NOT and AND. It also contains a memory storage that holds data and instructions.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="control unit"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Control Unit</h3>
	<p>Control units are integrated circuits that control and monitors the data sent to the computer by input and output devices.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="random access memory"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
	<p>The random access memory, or "RAM", is the hardware location inside a computer that contains the data, operating system and programs that the device is currently using. It allows the computer's processor to conveniently access the information.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="optical memory"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Optical Memory</h3>
	<p>Optical memory is a type of eletronic storage that stores data which is recorded, written and read over by a laser. They can be used to efficiently transport digital data and programs.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="magnetic memory"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Magnetic Memory</h3>
	<p>Magnetic memory is an option of storing data onto a magnetic medium such as hard drives.</p>

	</div>
	


	<a name="flash memory"></a>
    <div>
	<h3> Flash Memory</h3>
	<p>Flash memory is a kind of nonvolatile memory that erases and rewrites data found in units known as blocks in bytes. This is often used in consumer devices for storage and data.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<a name="logic gates"></a>
	<div>
	<h3>Logic Gates</h3>
	<p>Logic gates are electric circuits conprising of one or multiple inputs and one output, and are the foundation of digital systems. Examples of logic gates include the AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate.</p>
